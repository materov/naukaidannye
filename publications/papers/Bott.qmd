The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula which allows one to compute the dimension of the cohomology groups of the sheaf $\Omega_{\mathbb{P}}^p(D)= \Omega_{\mathbb{P}}^p\otimes {\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}}(D)$ of $p$-th differential forms Zariski twisted by an ample invertible sheaf on a complete simplicial toric variety. The formula involves some combinatorial sums of integer points over all faces of the support polytope for ${\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}}(D)$. Comparison of two versions of the Bott formula gives some elegant corollaries in the combinatorics of simple polytopes. Also, we obtain a generalization of the reciprocity law. Some applications of the Bott formula are discussed.
